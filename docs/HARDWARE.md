# TamperSafe — Hardware

Board facts and wiring rules live in `CLAUDE.md` and the `neurick-firmware` skill. This file holds TamperSafe's parts, wiring, mounting and tamper thresholds. Section numbers are referenced from `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and the plan.

## 1. Inventory: confirm with the team in M0 before any wiring

| Item | Planned part | Actual model | Supply | Check |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ultrasonic | HC-SR04 | **DROPPED** | — | Dropped for simplicity; lid tamper is handled purely by the IR sensor. |
| Motion (PIR) | HC-SR501 | **DROPPED** | — | Dropped for simplicity. Onboard MPU6050 handles shock/tilt if enabled. |
| IR lid sensor | FC-51 / TCRT5000 | **FC-51 IR obstacle module (CH15 / GPIO 15)** | 3.3 V | Primary physical tamper sensor; senses lid reflection. |
| GPS | u-blox NEO-6M | **NEO-6M (CH11)** | 3.3–5 V | Evidence only. |
| Latch servo | MG995 | **MG995 (Port S2)** | 12 V battery | High-torque servo latch. **Calibrated: LOCK = 180°, UNLOCK = 90°.** |
| Box | Cardboard/acrylic | **Physical demo box** | — | IR sensor on rim facing lid underside; servo latch inside. |
| RFID reader | RC522 | **RC522 on the extension board's RFID socket** | 3.3 V | SPI on GPIO 3 (SS), 18 (SCK), 17 (MOSI), 16 (MISO). Found by scan and verified: reads a tag UID and detects presence and removal. Version register reads 0x82 (a clone), so the library self-test reports FAIL; that is expected |
| Optional | LDR + 10 kΩ, microSD card | **LDR** (`sensors.xlsx` #18) and **8 GB Sandisk microSD** (`sensors.xlsx` #1) both confirmed in hand | 3.3 V | Stretch only |

## 2. Pin map

The GPIOs below are **proposed**. They avoid the unavailable pins, the strapping pins and ADC-only needs. Every header pin is **TBD: confirm against the Neurick manual**. A TBD row blocks any firmware that uses that pin.

| Function | Module pin | ESP32-S3 GPIO | Extension / P1 Pin | Supply | Level handling |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IR lid sensor** | OUT | **GPIO 15** | **CH15** (Header Pin 10) | 3.3 V | Direct. Primary physical tamper sensor; detects lid opening reflection. |
| **GPS → ESP (UART1 RX)** | TX | **GPIO 11** | **CH11** (Header Pin 28) | 3.3 V / 5 V | Direct if TX ≤ 3.3 V. Evidence-only. |
| **Latch servo** | Signal | STM32 servo **S2** | **Servo 2 port** | 12 V battery | `nr.servo(LOCK, LOCK, LOCK)` / `nr.servo(UNLOCK, UNLOCK, UNLOCK)`. All three channels commanded together. **LOCK = 180°, UNLOCK = 90°** (calibrated 29-Sep-2026). |
| **RFID Reader** | SPI | MFRC522 | **RFID socket: SS=GPIO 3, SCK=18, MOSI=17, MISO=16** | 3.3 V | Package binding via RFID tag UID, alert-only. The socket also routes RST to **GPIO 15, the IR sensor's pin**: leave the RC522's RST wire unplugged (open item: confirm the reader still answers without it). Receiver gain must stay mid-range; max gain saturates this clone. GPIO 3 is a strapping pin but works here. |
| **Onboard LDR** | AO | ADC1 (GPIO 4) | Extension board | 3.3 V | Interior light sensor for box integrity. |
| **Motion (PIR)** | — | — | **DROPPED** | — | Dropped for simplicity. |
| **Ultrasonic** | — | — | **DROPPED** | — | Dropped for simplicity. |
| **Motion / Shock / Tilt** | — | onboard MPU6050 `0x68` | Shared I2C (GPIO 8/9) | — | Built into Newrick board. |
| **Status Display** | — | onboard OLED `0x3C` | Shared I2C (GPIO 8/9) | — | Built into Newrick board. |
| **Depot / demo button**| — | STM32 `buttonState` | — | — | Long press in IDLE = local reset (demo). |

GPIO 12–18 are ADC2. They work as digital pins with Wi-Fi on, and only the stretch LDR is analog, so it takes the ADC1 pin. The RFID reader is SPI, so it needs its own dedicated pins in addition to the shared I2C bus (SDA=8, SCL=9) — do not reuse those two.

## 3. Power

- **Sensor load on the header 5 V / 3.3 V rails:** GPS ≈ 45 mA, HC-SR04 ≈ 15 mA, IR ≈ 20 mA. This is sensors only, which is what the rails are for.
- **Servo:** runs from the Neurick servo port, so the 12 V pack must be ON.
  - Move once to LOCK or UNLOCK, then hold. Avoid repeated re-commanding.
- **Untethered:** the box must run from the 12 V pack with USB unplugged. With the laptop's USB-C cable in, the ESP32 stays powered, so switching the pack off never produces `POWER_INTERRUPTED`.
- **Brownout:** a reset mid-transit reads as `POWER_INTERRUPTED` by design, so **a charged pack is a demo requirement**.
  - The firmware refuses SEAL when `batteryVolts` is below the threshold in §5.

## 4. Mounting

```
             side view, lid closed
   ┌──────[GPS antenna on top of lid]──────┐
   │ lid       [HC-SR04 facing down]   hook│◀── servo horn swings under the hook
   ├───────────────────────────────────────┤ ◀── IR module on the rim, facing lid underside
   │             ┌───────────┐             │
   │             │  package  │  ↕ baseline │
   │             │  (foam)   │    distance │
   │             └───────────┘             │
   └───────────────────────────────────────┘
   Neurick board + 12 V pack in a side compartment; OLED behind a window.
```

- **Ultrasonic:** on the underside of the lid, centred, pointing down at the package.
  - Keep the package top ≥ 5 cm below the sensor, because HC-SR04 readings are unreliable under ~2–3 cm.
  - A lifted lid makes the reading jump. A removed or swapped package shifts it to the floor or to the new height.
- **IR:** on the box rim, facing the lid's underside. Lid closed = reflection detected. Tune the module pot so it flips cleanly at about a 5 mm gap.
- **Servo latch:** on the inner wall. The horn swings under a hook fixed to the lid. Calibrate the LOCK and UNLOCK angles in M2.
- **Package:** pad it snugly with foam so that carrying the box does not move it (this matters for false tamper, §5).
- **GPS antenna:** on top of the lid, facing the sky. **Expect no fix indoors at the venue.**
- **Wiring:** loop the wires to the lid-mounted sensors through the hinge with slack.

## 5. Tamper thresholds (initial values; calibrate in M2, then overwrite this table)

| Signal | Sampling | Rule | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IR lid (CH15)** | 20 Hz | Lid reads open for 4 consecutive samples (200 ms) in SEALED | TAMPER `LID_OPENED` (1) |
| **Boot check** | — | NVS state is SEALED at boot | TAMPER `POWER_INTERRUPTED` (3) |
| **Shock** | 20 Hz | `abs(accel) > 2.5 g`, at most 1 per 10 s | ALERT `SHOCK` (10) |
| **Tilt** | 20 Hz | Tilt > 60° for 3 s | ALERT `TILT` (11) |
| **GPS** | every loop | Valid when TinyGPS location is valid and its age < 5 s | Evidence only |
| **RFID tag** | 1 Hz | Read tag UID at seal. While SEALED, tag UID absent or changed for 3 consecutive reads (3 s) | ALERT `PACKAGE_MISMATCH` (16) — evidence only, never TAMPER |
| Battery | 2 Hz | `batteryVolts` < 10.5 V → refuse SEAL, show `LOW BATT` | — |
| Servo | — | LOCK angle = 180°, UNLOCK angle = 90° (calibrated 29-Sep-2026, all three channels commanded together) | — |

## 6. Libraries (list them in the README)

- **Board and display:** `Newrick` (board library), Adafruit SSD1306 + Adafruit GFX.
- **Sensors and data:** TinyGPSPlus, ArduinoJson v7, MFRC522 (e.g. `miguelbalboa/rfid`) for the RFID reader.
- **ESP32 core:** WiFi, HTTPClient, Preferences (NVS), mbedtls (SHA-256, HMAC).
- **MPU6050:** read the raw registers over the shared bus, or use a library that accepts the existing `Wire` instance. Either way, re-run the I2C scan afterwards to confirm `0x3C` and `0x68` still answer.

## 7. Bring-up checklist (the M2 done-criterion)

1. Battery ON. The I2C scan shows `0x08`, `0x3C` and `0x68`.
2. Each sensor prints sane values on Serial **with Wi-Fi connected** (phone hotspot, 2.4 GHz).
3. The servo reaches LOCK and UNLOCK. With the latch locked, the lid cannot be lifted.
4. Seal the box, then walk it around the room for 60 s: **zero** tamper events.
5. Lift the lid 1 cm: `LID_OPENED` within 300 ms. Remove the package: `CONTENTS_DISTURBED` within 1.5 s.
6. Present the demo package's RFID tag, seal, then pull the tag away: `PACKAGE_MISMATCH` alert within 3 s, and confirm the order stays InTransit (no tamper, no escrow transition).
7. Write the calibrated thresholds and angles back into §5 and commit.
